# Template Design Pattern


  Clean way of representing processes that involves multiple steps, where each of those steps can involve some sort of variation depending on situtation.
Use this pattern where u find urself writing a large chunk of code again and again for seperal different situations, where each different version of this code
has just a slight variation/twerk here or there.


Writing a program meant to load, format and consoledate data from varity of sources. There can be many other sources to get thisd ata and each source will have same ste steps
