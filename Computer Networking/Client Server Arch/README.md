First, we had monolithic applications, where all the code—the user interface, the business logic, and the data storage—ran on a single, powerful (and expensive) mainframe computer.

Then we realized we could separate these pieces. This separation, enabled by standardized communication models, was revolutionary.

This gave us the client-server model:
- **The Server:** A powerful, centralized computer that handles the heavy lifting. It runs the main business logic, manages the database, and performs complex calculations. It's optimized for processing and storage.
- **The Client:** A less powerful, cheaper piece of hardware (like a desktop PC, a laptop, or now a smartphone) that primarily handles the user interface. Its main job is to take input from the user, send requests to the server, and display the server's response.

We needed a standard way for the client and server to talk to each other over a network, regardless of what operating system or hardware each was using.

This is where protocols like HTTP (for the web), SQL (for databases), and the underlying TCP/IP model come in.
